# Figure 1.36 (pg 53) in Sipser's Intro to Theory of Comp

# Same as samples/nfa_siper.tmf, but 'b' replaced with '127'
# > max value for default CELL_TYPE is CHAR_MAX (127)
# > Because epsilon and the max value of CELL_TYPE are hashed 
#   together, an epsilon bit differentiates the two for the 
#   transition fetching function (Trans_get in auto.c)
#
# This test is to ensure epsilon and 127 (assuming CELL_TYPE
# in auto.h is signed char) are properly differentiated.
